LAPPS Gate Converter Services
================================

Gate converters for the Language Applications Grid.  The classes in the [Gate Seraialization module](https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.lapps.gate.serialization) do the actual work of converting between LIF and GATE/XML and this module simply exposes those classes as LAPPS services.
